[00:38.62] Once upon a time
[00:40.71] Not so long ago
[00:48.21] 
[00:45.72] Tommy used to work on the docks
[00:49.69] Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
[00:53.37] It's tough, so tough
[01:03.37] 
[01:01.55] Gina works the diner all day
[01:05.54] Working for her man, she brings home her pay for love
[01:11.61] Mmm, for love
[01:18.11] 
[01:16.05] She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
[01:21.00] It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
[01:25.08] We got each other, and that's a lot for love
[01:30.76] We'll give it a shot"
[01:41.26] 
[01:33.08] Whoa, we're half way there
[01:36.94] Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
[01:40.88] Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
[01:44.62] Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
[01:57.12] 
[01:52.55] Tommy's got his six-string in hock
[01:56.16] Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
[01:59.81] So tough, ooh, it's tough
[02:12.31] 
[02:08.15] Gina dreams of running away
[02:11.75] When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
[02:14.94] "Baby it's okay, someday"
[02:27.44] 
[02:22.89] We've gotta hold on to what we've got
[02:27.54] It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
[02:31.49] We got each other, and that's a lot for love
[02:37.12] We'll give it a shot"
[02:47.62] 
[02:39.34] Oh, we're half way there
[02:43.38] Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer
[02:47.05] Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
[02:51.03] Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
[02:54.93] Livin' on a prayer
[03:03.93] 
[03:14.08] Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
[03:20.15] You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
[03:47.15] 
[03:23.65] Whoa, we're half way there
[03:27.67] Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
[03:31.52] Take my hand, and we'll make it, I swear
[03:35.21] Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
[03:48.71] 
[03:39.01] Whoa, we're half way there
[03:43.14] Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
[03:46.86] Take my hand, and we'll make it, I swear
[03:50.72] Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
[03:54.42] Whoa, we're half way there
[03:58.53] Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
[04:02.41] Take my hand, and we'll make it, I swear
[04:06.17] Woah-ah
