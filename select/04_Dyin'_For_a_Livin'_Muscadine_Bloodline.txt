Well, my
Baby, she's a fussin' and a cussin' as I'm packin' the truck
I ain't workin' for her daddy and her momma thinks I need to grow up
Yeah, sangin' these songs is like slangin' a drug
Call it country band contraband
Can't get enough
Of this pickin', grinnin'
Dyin' for a livin'
Probably gonna kill me but it'd kill me if I didn't
It's a fix to my addiction, it's a sin to my religion
It is what it is and it ain't what it isn't
I'm a honky-tonkin' dead man walkin', never quittin'
Just a pickin', grinnin'
Dyin' for a livin', yeah
Well them rowdy little rodeo queens are struttin', cuttin' a rug
And them cocaine cowboys gettin' lit and tearin' it up
Yeah, the sun'll be up before we call it a night
I know it's takin' its toll but it's a hell of a high
Just a pickin', grinnin'
Dyin' for a livin'
Probably gonna kill me but it'd kill me if I didn't
It's a fix to my addiction, it's a sin to my religion
It is what it is and it ain't what it isn't
I'm a honky-tonkin' dead man walkin', never quittin'
Just a pickin', grinnin'
Dyin' for a livin'
Just a pickin', grinnin'
Dyin' for a livin'
Probably gonna kill me but it'd kill me if I didn't
It's a fix to my addiction, it's a sin to my religion
It is what it is and it ain't what it isn't
I'm a honky-tonkin' dead man walkin', never quittin'
Just a pickin', grinnin'
Dyin' for a livin'
I'm a honky-tonkin' dead man walkin', never quittin'
Just a pickin', grinnin'
Dyin' for a livin'
